# CNN_NCL
Method of combining one-dimensional convolution neural network and negative correlation learning for analysis of near-infrared spectra

Dataset
The dataset consists of 80 corn samples measured by three separate near-infrared instrumentals (m5, mp5 and mp6) over a wavelength range of 1100-2498 nm at a 2nm interval [â€¦]. The corn properties to be predicted are moisture, oil, protein and starch. In this study, m5 data was chosen to test the impact of parameters on the model, and mp5 and m6 were used to further verify the efficiency of the algorithm. In addition, the outliers (75 and 77) are removed from this dataset
