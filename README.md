# CNN_NCL
Method of combining one-dimensional convolution neural network and negative correlation learning for analysis of near-infrared spectra

## Dataset
* [NIR of Corn Sample for Standardization Benchmarking](http://www.eigenvector.com/data/Corn/index.html) <br>
> m5 data was chosen to build the model. In addition, the outliers (75 and 77) are removed from this dataset. Ramdonly choose 62 sampels for cailbration,8 for vaildation and 8 for prediction.Since there are only 78 samples in the dataset, we preform SMOTE algorithm on it.
* [Near Infrared Spectra of Diesel Fuels](http://www.eigenvector.com/data/SWRI/index.html)<br>
 > There are three formats of these data. Standard Matlab Variable Format was used.
