# CNN_NCL
Method of combining one-dimensional convolution neural network and negative correlation learning for analysis of near-infrared spectra

## Dataset
* 1.[NIR of Corn Sample for Standardization Benchmarking](http://www.eigenvector.com/data/Corn/index.html)
    m5 data was chosen to build the model. In addition, the outliers (75 and 77) are removed from this dataset. Since there are only 78     samples in the dataset, we preform SMOTE algorithm on it.
* 2.[Near Infrared Spectra of Diesel Fuels](http://www.eigenvector.com/data/SWRI/index.html)
